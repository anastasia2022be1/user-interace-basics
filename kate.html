            including Outstanding Lead Actress for Winslet, Outstanding Supporting Actress for

          recent murder of a teenage mother while trying to keep her own life from falling apart.

          25 years earlier. She has also been unable to solve the case of another missing young girl

            Ingelsby, O'Connor, Kate Winslet, Paul Lee, Mark Roybal, and Gordon Gray. In January
            2020, it was announced that Craig Zobel would replace O'Connor as director due to
            scheduling issues and also serve as executive producer. Regarding the setting, Ingelsby
            stated "sort of an amalgam" which he explained "It’s Coatesville, it’s Aston, it’s
            Drexel Hill." Ingelsby stated that he chose the name Easttown because "it sounded like
            such a generic town name.
